Crafting \u000d\u000ayour own spices unlocks the secret of powerful and full-flavored dishes.\u000d\u000aThink about the first time you cooked \u000d\u000awith salt. I bet you reach for it every time you \u000d\u000acook now. But before you tried it, I\u2019m sure \u000d\u000ayou didn\u2019t feel as though you were missing \u000d\u000aanything. It\u2019s the same with crafting homemade spice blends.\u000d\u000aSpice blends are a common theme \u000d\u000athroughout Mediterranean cooking. They are \u000d\u000aused to elevate a dish\u2019s flavor, without adding \u000d\u000acalories or fat. Remaining involved in your \u000d\u000acooking process is the essence of the Mediterranean Diet, and creating your own spice \u000d\u000ablends is just another way to accomplish this!\u000d\u000aMost spice blends will last up to one year \u000d\u000aif you store them in an airtight, glass container. You can easily find these at your local \u000d\u000asupermarket or dollar store. Keep your blends \u000d\u000ain a dark cupboard away from your oven, as \u000d\u000asunlight and heat will spoil your mixtures.\u000d\u000aWhen crafting your own spice blends, remember to use dried herbs. They offer a more \u000d\u000aintense flavor than fresh herbs! However, if \u000d\u000ayou decide to incorporate fresh herbs, triple \u000d\u000athe quantities listed below.","Since these blends last a while, I love gifting them to my friends and \u000d\u000afamily. I find that people prefer these as gifts because spice blends can be \u000d\u000aused for months! Plus, they show your loved one that you put effort and \u000d\u000athought into their gift.\u000d\u000aThe following 10 spice blend recipes will enhance your recipes in many \u000d\u000aways. Keep track of which blends you enjoy and which foods they pair well \u000d\u000awith.

Personally, I love using this mixture with Greek yogurt as a marinade for lamb, beef, or chicken.\u000d\u000aThe cinnamon in this recipe adds a surprisingly distinct \u000d\u000aflavor. The sweet and woodsy taste compliments the savory \u000d\u000aherbs in authentic Greek fashion. This blend can be used \u000d\u000aon pretty much anything, but it works especially well with \u000d\u000aroasted vegetables, kabobs, fish, grilled meats, pasta, and \u000d\u000abean salads. You can even mix it in with your salad dressing \u000d\u000aor hummus for an extra punch of flavor!","10 HOMEMADE MEDITERRANEAN SPICE BLENDS\u000d\u000a12\u000d\u000a1 tbsp. garlic powder\u000d\u000a1 tbsp.

The key is spicing\u000d\u000ayour vegetables! Once you experiment with the various flavors, you\u2019ll discover that vegetables can be just as flavorful \u000d\u000aas meat. Don\u2019t worry, you don\u2019t have to believe me now. I \u000d\u000aknow you\u2019ll change your mind once you try this spice blend. \u000d\u000aIt\u2019s worth mentioning that sage is an acquired flavor, so if \u000d\u000ayou\u2019re not a fan, skip it!\u000d\u000aPepper this blend on your vegetables before baking or \u000d\u000agrilling.
